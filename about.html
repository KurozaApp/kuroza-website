                Kuroza was born out of a simple but universal frustration: <span class="font-semibold">staying connected
                with friends shouldn't be this difficult</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Between <b>busy</b> schedules, <b>clashing</b> commitments, and <b>endless</b> group chats that never 
                lead anywhere, planning a get-together often feels harder than the hangout itself. We created 
                <span class="font-semibold text-kuroza-red">Kuroza</span> to change that.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                At its core, <span class="font-semibold text-kuroza-red">Kuroza</span> is a social organiser that <b>removes
                the stress from planning events</b> and brings back the joy of spending time with <b>the people who matter</b>.

                By using <b>smart suggestions</b> based on your group's availability and
                preferences, <span class="font-semibold text-kuroza-red">Kuroza</span> helps you skip the back-and-forth 
                messages and jump straight to <b>making memories</b>.

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
                Whether it's a quick coffee, a study session, or a full weekend trip, the app makes it <b>effortless</b> to turn ideas
                into reality.

                Unlike traditional event apps, <span class="font-semibold text-kuroza-red">Kuroza</span> is designed for everyday use. 
                It's not just for birthdays or big nights out—it's for the <b>smaller, more meaningful moments</b> that strengthen 
                <b>friendships</b> over time. Our focus is on simplicity, reliability, and making social life feel natural again in 
                a world where it's easy to drift apart.

                vision reaches far beyond campus. We imagine <span class="font-semibold text-kuroza-red">Kuroza</span> becoming the
